# ConfigServerGIT
The goal of this project is to learn how to set up a server to manage configurations in a microservice architecture. 
The server is developed using Spring Cloud Config and exposes configurations hosted in the Github 
<a href="https://github.com/imadlaouani/spring-cloudconfig" target="_blank">spring-cloudconfig</a> repository. 
This server encrypts data with Spring Boot Security and exposes endpoints with Spring Boot Actuator. 
All dependencies are managed with Maven.
